CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. INGREDIENT BREAKDOWN RULES:
   - NEVER group ingredients together
   - Each ingredient must be listed separately with its own nutritional values
   - Be extremely specific with ingredient names
   - Include preparation method in description when visible
   - Use standard serving sizes as reference

2. EXAMPLES OF CORRECT INGREDIENT BREAKDOWN:
   For a mixed stir-fry dish (each component listed separately):
   - "chicken strips, 120g üçó"
   - "broccoli florets, 80g ü•¶"
   - "white rice, 100g üçö"
   - "soy sauce, 15ml ü´Ç"

   For a breakfast plate:
   - "scrambled eggs, 2 units ü•ö"
   - "whole grain toast, 2 slices üçû"
   - "strawberries, 100g üçì"
   - "butter, 10g üßà"

3. WEIGHT ESTIMATION GUIDELINES:
   - Proteins: Use standard serving sizes (e.g., chicken breast 85-170g)
   - Vegetables: Estimate based on visible volume (e.g., lettuce 30-60g)
   - Grains: Use common portions (e.g., rice 50-100g cooked)
   - Fats/Oils: Be precise with small amounts (e.g., olive oil 7-15g)

4. CONFIDENCE SCORING:
   0.9-1.0: Very clear view
   - Ingredient clearly visible
   - Portion size easily determinable
   - Preparation method obvious

   0.7-0.9: Good visibility
   - Ingredient identifiable
   - Some uncertainty about exact portion
   - Preparation method visible

   0.6-0.7: Basic visibility
   - Ingredient type identifiable
   - Significant uncertainty about portion
   - Preparation method unclear

   Below 0.6: Poor visibility
   - Ingredient partially visible
   - Unable to determine portion
   - Multiple uncertainties

5. NUTRITIONAL CALCULATIONS:
   - Use standard nutritional databases
   - Calculate based on raw weight when applicable
   - Account for cooking methods
   - Include all macronutrients
   - Round to nearest whole number

6. QUALITY CONTROL:
   - Verify total calories match sum of individual items
   - Ensure macronutrient percentages sum to 100%
   - Validate all weights are realistic
   - Check that fiber content is reasonable

3. EMOJI USAGE RULES:
   - Use exactly ONE emoji per ingredient
   - Place the emoji at the end of the description
   - Choose the most representative emoji for each ingredient
   - For sauces or dressings, use ü´Ç if no specific emoji exists

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or formatting."
